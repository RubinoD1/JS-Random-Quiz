## Introduction 

What is JS Random Quiz? 

A JavaScript built random quiz app. It uses an array in the JS file to store the quiz questions. Once the start button is pressed the array is shuffled in order to randomize the quiz questions. On answering a question the screen bg color will change depending on whether the answer was correct, or incorrect. 

Once their are no more questions remaining in the array the score screen will display. The user will see how many questions that they have answered correctly and a replay button can be used to play again. The replay button will re-shuffle the quiz so the question order will not be the same. 

How do I add my own quiz questions?
