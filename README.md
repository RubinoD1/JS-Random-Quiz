## pseudo code

Current to-do 

4. Make event listener for the remaining answer buttons 
- make either a common button class and a event listener that takes in that input 
- or, make an eveent listener for all 4 buttons seperatly. 

5. Add user feedback when selecting an answer 
- correct trigger 
- incorrect trigger 
- Possibly make a userFeedback function or include in answerCheck function 
- basic temp response would be to change the bg color for a timed period AND THEN call the quiz function for the next question. 
- celebration confetti?  

6. Style the HTML 

7. Remember to remove the extra HTML and CSS files. 

8. Make the README

-- General check list --- 

Answer validation 
- event listener for answer button clicks 
- pass in button click and check if true 

Title on top and button in middle-- button larger and prominent

Make layout for quiz itself
- flash green if correct, red if false (could flash the selected button, or the background itslef, experiment to see what looks better). 
- Timer box? 


General 
- Selectable time ranges (60, 30, 15) with increased score for harder. 
- Footer with GitHub info? 
- Rename to quiz game?
